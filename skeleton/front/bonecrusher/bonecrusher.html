                <p><em>Once known as the Gravebound Titans, Bonecrusher Skeletons were not born of random necromancy‚Äîbut
                        forged through deliberate cruelty. These monstrosities were once champions of brutal arenas,
                        warlords‚Äô enforcers, and executioners of ancient tyrants. When death finally claimed them, their
                        broken forms were entombed with iron bindings to prevent their vengeful souls from rising
                        again.</em></p>
                <p><em>But in times of dark magic and unholy wars, these bindings served as anchors‚Äînot prison.</em></p>
                <p><em>Now, Bonecrusher Skeletons stalk the ruins of ancient cities and bloodied battlefields, animated
                        by sheer hatred and fused with black bone-iron. Their hulking forms are too large for simple
                        swords to take down easily, and they know no fear. Necromancers do not command Bonecrushers‚Äîthey
                        unleash them.</em></p>
                <p><em>It is said that when one walks, the bones of the dead stir in fear.</em></p>
                <p><em>And when it falls‚Ä¶ beware the silence‚Äîfor that is when it may rise again.</em></p>
