                <p><em>When the air grows cold and the moon turns crimson, beware the fluttering shadows that blot the
                        sky. A Swarm of Bats is no mere nuisance—it is a herald of something deeper, older, and
                        darker.</em></p>

                <p><em>These creatures are often found in places where vampiric energies have seeped into the
                        land—crypts, cursed forests, or the lairs of ancient bloodlords. Drawn to the scent of decay and
                        the echo of fear, they serve as both scouts and sentinels.</em></p>

                <p><em>What makes them truly dangerous is not their bite, but their intent. A swarm in frenzy becomes
                        chaos incarnate, disorienting prey, masking footsteps, and buying precious seconds for something
                        worse to arrive.</em></p>

                <p><em>In the Crimson Dominion, they are said to be Thalyri’s messengers—the eyes that never sleep, the
                        wings that never stop.</em></p>

                <p><em>If they fly before you, turn back. If they circle overhead, <strong>run</strong>. But if they
                        descend… it is already too late.</em></p>
