            <h2>About the Crimson Dominion</h2>
            <p><em>The great and overarching bloodline of shadow and dread is hight <strong>The Crimson
                        Dominion</strong>, a dominion wrought in the veiled mists of bygone centuries, established under
                    the divine aegis of <strong>Thalyris, the Crimson Queen</strong>. This immortal sovereign, dark of
                    grace and fierce in her crimson majesty, hath bound her children unto her eternal will, forging a
                    legacy steeped in both blood and power. Though each noble house within the dominion doth boast its
                    own storied history and sacred purpose, all are united in their unyielding fealty to Thalyris and
                    the insatiable thirst that doth bind their kind.</em></p>
            <p><em>Lo, the world beneath their shadowy grasp is cleft into five houses, each distinct in its strength
                    and ambition. Foremost among these stands <strong>House Sangrelis</strong>, whose dominion and might
                    are unmatched. This house seeketh to extend its sovereign reach and turn the mortal lands unto their
                    boundless hunting grounds. Beside them dwell the other houses, none lesser in craft nor cunning.
                    <strong>House Velkynne</strong>, shrouded in secrets and dark sorceries. <strong>House
                        Drevalth</strong>, stalwart and unyielding, with iron resolve and martial pride. <strong>House
                        Vyrathis</strong>, masters of intrigue and shadows, weaving schemes with a deftness unmatched.
                    And lastly, <strong>House Oryndel</strong>, keepers of eldritch lore and ancient whispers, guardians
                    of knowledge forbidden and arcane.</em></p>
            <p><em>Together they stand, divided in purpose yet bound by the unholy covenant of their queen. For the
                    Crimson Dominion doth strive not merely to rule, but to reshape the world as a red-stained empire
                    where darkness reigneth eternal and blood floweth as the river beneath the moonless sky.</em></p>
