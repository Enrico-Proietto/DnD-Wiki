                <h3>Backstory</h3>
                Azreal is the master of infernal contracts, tricking mortals and devils alike into binding agreements
                that always work in his favor. His deals often appear fair, or even generous, but every contract
                contains hidden clauses that lead to damnation. Azreal was once a mortal king who bartered his soul for
                eternal power, rising to become one of Hell's most cunning manipulators.

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                Azreal seeks to claim the greatest prize of all—complete dominion over mortal souls, forcing the gods to
                become irrelevant as he hoards all life under his control through deals and deceit. He dreams of making
                Hell the greatest empire in the cosmos, where all beings are bound to him.
