                <h3>Lore</h3>
                Soryn, the Goddes of Fate, is a mysterious and quiet deity who silently weaves the fates of mortals and
                gods alike. Unlike Aelos, whose fortune can shift like the wind, Soryn’s power lies in the unseen forces
                of inevitability. She is often depicted as a solemn, ethereal figure, clothed in robes that shimmer like
                starlight, her eyes reflecting the endless paths of time.<br><br>According to legend, Soryn was born
                from the first breath of creation, when time itself began to move forward. Her birthright was the
                control over the flow of fate—ensuring that all things come to their destined end. Her is said to dwell
                in the Nexus of Threads, a vast and cosmic loom where the lives of mortals are spun into intricate
                patterns that cannot be undone.<br><br>Despite his quiet nature, Soryn is far from passive. Her subtly
                influences the course of events, guiding or gently shifting the threads of fate when necessary. Her is
                the patron of prophets, seers, and those who seek to uncover the mysteries of the future. Her followers
                believe that while fate is inevitable, it can be understood and even subtly altered by those who
                understand its patterns.<br><br>Worship of Soryn is both revered and feared, for while she governs
                destiny, she also represents the unavoidable truths of life: death, endings, and the unknown. Her
                temples are serene places, often filled with tapestries and patterns representing the interwoven paths
                of all beings. The clergy of Soryn, known as the Weavers of Destiny, are known for their wisdom and
                their ability to interpret the subtle signs of fate.

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                Soryn seeks to ensure that the balance of fate is maintained, that every soul follows the path woven for
                them by the strands of destiny, though his hand may subtly guide or unravel those threads when needed.
