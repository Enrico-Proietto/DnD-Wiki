                <h3>Lore</h3>
                Zurathis, once a brilliant and respected Archmage named Tharion, delved too deeply into the forbidden
                arts in his relentless quest for knowledge and power. His obsession led him to uncover ancient,
                malevolent forces that twisted his mind and soul. In a desperate bid to achieve ultimate power, Tharion
                performed a cataclysmic ritual that transformed him into Zurathis, a primordial entity of dark
                magic.<br><br>pon his transformation, Zurathis discovered an affinity for the most sinister and
                corrupting forms of magic. His presence began to infect the very fabric of the magical weave, spreading
                shadow and chaos wherever he tread. As his influence grew, so did his following. Those who were tempted
                by the promise of forbidden knowledge and power flocked to his banner, forming the Cult of the Shadow
                Veil.<br><br>Zurathis's followers believe that true power lies in the mastery of dark magic and that the
                weak should serve those who possess such power. They perform rituals in his name, seeking to gain his
                favor and further his insidious goals. Through their dark rites, they aim to summon and harness
                nightmarish entities from the shadow realms and unleash them upon the world..
