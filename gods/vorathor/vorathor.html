                <h3>Lore</h3>
                Vorathor was once a celestial servant of balance, tasked with guiding souls from life to death. Over
                time, he grew resentful of the living for clinging so desperately to life and of the gods who interfered
                with the natural order by granting resurrection or immortality.<br><br>Turning from his celestial
                origins, Vorathor descended into a nihilistic madness. He declared that death should not only be
                inevitable but final. He began severing souls' ties to the afterlife, trapping them in his domain of
                Endless Quiet, a gray, featureless expanse devoid of sensation, thought, or memory.<br><br>The other
                gods fear Vorathor for his power over the cycle of life and death, but they hesitate to act against him,
                as his role is still vital to maintaining the world's balance.

                    <h3>Bargain: The Coin of Death</h3>
                    It is whispered among mortals that, upon thy deathbed, when Vorathor, the dread God of Death, cometh
                    to bear thee unto the shadowed realm of the departed, thou mayest entreat him for a wager most
                    perilous—a casting of the Death Coin. Once the challenge be spoken, it may not be undone, and the
                    outcome shall be immutable, binding as the eternal stars.<br><br>Vorathor shall then draw forth his
                    fateful coin, inscribed with the solemn phrases: “Memento Mori” (Remember thy death) and “Memet
                    Vivre” (Live again). With a flick of his hand, he shall send it spinning through the air, a decision
                    between life and eternal torment.<br><br>Should the coin fall upon “Memet Vivre,” thy soul shall be
                    restored unto the realm of the living. This reprieve is granted with but one purpose—that thou might
                    live thy life anew, with greater wisdom and fuller heart. Yet beware, for should it fall upon
                    “Memento Mori,” thy fate shall be grim indeed. Thou shalt be cast irrevocably into the depths of
                    Vorathor’s dominion, punished for thy audacious hope of resurrection. In that dread realm shalt thou
                    languish, a shadow among shadows, until the Lord of Death himself show thee mercy. But hear this
                    well: some say that death is the truest mercy. To defy such mercy is to forfeit thy peace; thus
                    shalt thou endure, not in rest, but in endless, unyielding existence for eternity.
