                <h3>Lore</h3>
                Once, Thalyris was a radiant goddess of love, beauty, and life. Her presence was said to illuminate even
                the darkest corners of existence, her voice a soothing melody that could mend hearts and inspire mortals
                to feats of unimaginable greatness. She was beloved by mortals and deities alike, her crimson hair
                symbolizing the passion of life itself. Yet, beneath this shining exterior, a simmering hunger for
                devotion grew unchecked—a hunger that would lead to her fall.<br><br>Thalyris craved not only the love
                of mortals but their absolute submission. She wished for no mortal heart to beat for another, no prayer
                to be spoken for any god but her. Her divine siblings grew wary of her insatiable desire, for it was
                whispered among the heavens that her longing was born not of love, but of control. When she sought to
                impose her will upon a world she claimed to adore, the other gods intervened.<br><br>Enraged at their
                betrayal, Thalyris turned to forbidden knowledge, delving into the shadowed realms of the void. From
                this dark study, she discovered a way to twist her divine essence, shedding her radiance and emerging as
                a being of blood and domination. Her once-beautiful crimson hair became a pulsating, otherworldly mass
                that mirrored her new nature—a seething, unholy desire to consume and dominate all that
                lived.<br><br>Her transformation was catastrophic. The very lands she had nurtured were drowned in
                crimson storms as her essence corrupted the realms she once protected. Mortals who adored her were
                transformed into thralls, their blood becoming a conduit for her growing power. Those who resisted found
                their minds fractured by her whispers, compelled to love her against their will.<br><br>The gods,
                horrified, sought to imprison her, but Thalyris was too cunning. She wove her chains into the fabric of
                mortal existence, ensuring that as long as blood flowed and love persisted, her influence would remain.
                She fled to her dominion, the Crimson Dominion, a shadowy plane of endless red skies and rivers of
                blood, where she rules over legions of vampiric followers.<br><br>Now, Thalyris plots to return to the
                mortal plane, using her devotees to spread her influence. She offers mortals eternal beauty, power, and
                love in exchange for their blood and devotion, twisting them into tools of her will. Her ultimate goal
                is not just to reclaim her throne among the gods but to enthrall the entirety of creation, binding all
                to her insatiable hunger.

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                To enthrone herself as the eternal ruler of the mortal and divine realms, transforming all who oppose
                her into her thralls. She seeks to spread vampirism as the "ultimate evolution" and claims that only
                through her blessings can true immortality be achieved.
