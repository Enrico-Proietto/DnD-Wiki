                <h3>Lore</h3>
                In the ancient epochs, Elorthas was a lesser deity known only as a mediator among divine conflicts. They
                served as an impartial judge, resolving disputes between gods of light and darkness, law and chaos.
                However, during the Shattering Era, when the gods fractured into countless pantheons due to infighting
                and mortal wars, Elorthas witnessed the endless suffering this division caused.<br><br>Moved by the
                devastation, Elorthas ascended to greater godhood through an act of ultimate selflessness: surrendering
                their individual purpose and identity to embody the shared essence of every divine being. In doing so,
                Elorthas became a god that all deities could see as a reflection of themselves, fostering cooperation
                between those who might otherwise be enemies.<br><br>Their teachings spread among mortals as a beacon of
                hope in divided lands. Though their efforts are often met with skepticism—both from mortals unwilling to
                abandon their own beliefs and gods resistant to unity—Elorthas remains steadfast in their mission. They
                whisper to champions, inspire prophets, and manifest as subtle signs of harmony in the most unlikely
                places.

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                To unite all pantheons and religions under a shared ethos of harmony and cooperation. Elorthas believes
                that by mending the rifts between gods and their followers, mortals and divinities alike can achieve a
                golden age of balance, peace, and enlightenment.
