                <h3>Lore</h3>
                Anos Voldigoad, known as the Infernal Patron, is a Tiefling god of immense power and malevolence. Once a
                figure of supreme might, he ruled over his followers with an iro;n fist, commanding their loyalty
                through fear and dark promises. His dominion was vast, and his name was spoken in hushed tones across
                the realms. However, his reign was marked bu constant strife and bloodshed, leading to the near
                extinction of his followers.
                <br><br>Anos demands unwavering loyalty from his kin, the Tieflings, whom he views as his chosen people.
                His teachings promote the belief that Tieflings are superior beings, destined to dominate through chaos
                and infernal power. This exclusivity has led to a decline in his followers, as many have perished in
                their relentless pursuits of power and destruction.<br><br>In his prime, Anos was feared by gods and
                mortals alike. Now, his strength wanes, his influence diminished, yet he remains a potent and dangerous
                entity. His remaining worshippers are fanatical, clinging to the hope that their dark god will rise to
                power once more.
